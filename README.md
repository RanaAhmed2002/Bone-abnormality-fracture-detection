Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection of bone abnormalities, specifically through two main components: Bone Type Classification and Fracture Detection. Leveraging deep learning techniques, particularly the ResNet50 architecture, we aim to advance the field of medical imaging diagnostics.

Part 1: Bone Type Classification
In this first part, we classify limb bones into specific categories: toes, hand, wrist, elbow, knee, and shoulder. Using the ResNet50 model, we achieved an impressive classification accuracy of 97%. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in successfully identifying and categorizing various bone types, which is crucial for accurate diagnoses in orthopedic practices.

Part 2: Fracture Detection
The second part of our project revolves around detecting fractures in bone images. To achieve the highest overall accuracy, we experimented with different deep learning models. Our best-performing model reached an accuracy of 87%, showcasing the potential of automated fracture detection systems in enhancing diagnostic capabilities.

Dataset
For our project, we utilized two key datasets: MURA (Musculoskeletal radiographs) and additional labeled data for our classification tasks. The MURA dataset consists of X-ray images specifically designed for bone abnormality detection, enabling our models to train effectively on a diverse range of bone conditions and fractures.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in the field of medical imaging, paving the way for future advancements in automated diagnosis and treatment recommendations. We believe that our findings can significantly contribute to improved patient care and clinical efficiency.
